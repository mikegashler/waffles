		<br>

		<br><br><br><b>2011-8-25</b><br><br>
		Added a tool to auto-tune the parameters of supervised learners.
		Added an app for sparse matrix learning tools.
		Added an app for dimensionality reduction tools.
		Added an app for tools that process audio signals.
		Added BASH command-completion for all of the apps.
		Added singular-value-decomposition to the sparse matrix class.
		Improved the performance of our LLE implementation.
		Added the matrix factorization and nonlinear PCA collaborative filters.
		Added bagging ensembles of collaborative filters.
		Added options to print confusion matrices.
		Added the fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm.
		Enabled k-means to utilize custom distance metrics.
		Switch to JSON for our serialization format (instead of TWT).
		Improved the wizard tool.
		Merged the GSup and GClasses libraries.
		Added a random forest class.
		Added automatic missing-value imputation to supervised learners.
		Added calibration for all supervised learning algorithms that can predict distributions.

		<br><br><br><b>2011-3-17</b><br><br>
		Added Win64 as a build target. Made all learning models support multi-dimensional labels.
		Made learning algorithms automatically handle data type-conversion. (It is no longer necessary
		to wrap them in an appropriate filter.) Improved the wizard tool. (It is now web-based, and provides
		default values.) Add support to train k-NN with sparse matrices. Significantly improved the
		documentation. Added some new activation functions. Added a simple machine learning demo.
		Added LU matrix  decomposition. Brought back the jumper demo. Some performance improvements. Added the
		NeuroPCA algorithm. Improved the way command-line tools display usage information. Added a
		recommender system command-line tool with a few collaborative filtering algorithms. Added the
		security demo app. Improved standards compliance. Removed several redundant and not-very-useful classes.
		Redesigned learning interfaces to be more developer-friendly. Added several new unit tests.

		<br><br><br><b>2010-11-5</b><br><br>
		Fixed issues with OSX compatibility. Added lots of comments to make the API docs more complete.
		Made GDecisionTree more conformant with the random forest algorithm. Added a recommender system
		demo. Added a demo for unsupervised back-prop. Updated GNeuralNet to support the dynamic addition
		and removal of nodes. Also added support for custom activation functions. Added a switch to the
		learn tool so you can specify which attributes to use for labels, and which attributes to ignore.
		Threw out GQueue, GAVLTree, and other classes that were redundant with the STL. (Also threw out
		everything that depended on these classes, such as the path-search algorithms and GRelationalTable.
		Sorry if you were using those--I think this is good churn, though.) Moved all the classes into
		a GClasses namespace. Separated all of the classes not related to machine learning
		into a supplemental library called GSup. (That means you now have
		to link to two libraries, GClasses and GSup, to get all of my functionality. Again, sorry if this
		breaks your code, but I think this is good churn.) Renamed the "categorize" filter to "nominaltocat".
		Improved the plot overview tool wrt nominal features. Made GData::determinant more efficient.
		Added clarifications to the licenses of the demo apps. Restructured the demo apps to be entirely
		contained in a single folder. (This makes them easier to clone.) Rewrote GRand to be inherently 64-bit based.
		Also improved 64-bit compliance with GData, GTwt and other classes. Added a tool for aligning data. Added
		an uninstall option to the Makefile for Linux. Merged all of the Windows .sln files into a single
		monolithic solution that builds everything (to simplify testing). Added the hello_console and hello_web demo apps.
		Rewrote the interpolation demo app to show more interpolation and to support more algorithms.
		Added random and brute-force optimizers for baseline comparisons. Added a linear programming solver and
		a linear regression learner.

			<a href="http://download.famouswhy.com/">FamousWhy</a> gave Waffles the editor's pick
			award. Thanks. Are these awards just attempts by these sites to boost their Google
			rating? I have no idea. I'll let Google sort that out. These guys actually offered to
			perform an interview and write up some tutorials, so it seems that they are willing to
			work for the link.

		tool that replaces the rank tool, the charting tool, and the predictive
		accuracy tool. Added confidence estimates to all the learning
		algorithms. Added a tool to make precision/recall charts. Added a tool
		for augmenting data sets. Seriously improved the GUI. Added various
		tools for data mining. Redesigned the GSupervisdedLearner class. Made

		<br><br><br><b>2007-01-11</b><br><br>Added some new image processing
		tools: a max-flow graph cut class, a region ajacency graph class, a
		video class, methods to compute gradient magnitude images, and a
		morphing class. Added a K-means clustering class, a couple new learning
		algorithms, some code for computing eigenvectors, a new tool for
		ranking learning algorithms, improved the documentation, and fixed many
		bugs.

		<br><br><br><b>2006-09-06</b><br><br>Added a GBag class (for bagging
		ensembles), Random Forest, Arbitrary Arboretum, and PC Forest. Added
		some code for computing eigenvectors, an algorithm that computes
		principle components of data in many dimensions without needing to

		a discreet path search algorithm, did a good deal of general code clean
		up, integrated some changes contributed by Roger Pack into various
		classes, and fixed about ten bugs. Also thanks to Kevin Kemp for
		getting it to build on Mac without having to include a special
		framework in the package. I also added some unpolished tools for making
		charts and added a link to the API docs from the main menu.

		<br><br><br><b>2006-03-23</b><br><br>
		This is a bug fix release. If you were getting a build error in
		GKeyboard.cpp on Windows, that's fixed now.

		<br><br><br><b>2006-03-11</b><br><br>
		Ported to Mac OSX Tiger. Thanks to Helaman Ferguson for much of this
		work. It now works on Mac, Linux, and Windows.

		<br><br><br><b>2006-02-25</b><br><br>Added a new efficient
		neighbor-finding class. The KNN algorithm is much faster now. Fixed
		many bugs. Added a ray-tracing demo. This isn't really related to
		machine learning, but I have some plans in the future to try combining
		it with learning algorithms to do model reconstruction. The manifold
		learning demo demonstrates both unsupervised and semi-supervised
		manifold learning now.

		<br><br><br><b>2005-12-31</b><br><br>Added a particle swarm algorithm
		and some other search algorithms. Fixed some issues with the genetic
		algorithm. The Neural Net interpolation demo now compares several
		search algorithms. (Backprop is the clear winner, but it's not a
		totally fair comparison because backprop is running in incremental mode
		while the others are doing batch mode.)

		<br><br><br><b>2005-12-17</b><br><br>
		This is mostly a bug-fixing release.

		<br><br><br><b>2005-12-03</b><br><br>
		Added automated tests for several of the classes.

		<br><br><br><b>2005-11-27</b><br><br>The project is now released to the
		public. It builds in VS6 on Windows and with g++ on Linux.
